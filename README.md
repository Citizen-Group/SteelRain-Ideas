# Steel Rain: Ideas
**Steel Rain** is a work in progress total conversion mod for ARMA Reforger. 

Steel Rain borrows strong gameplay elements and direction from the top down MMO Foxhole, but retools them for the first person perspective and the strengths, scope and scale of Reforger/ARMA 4. 

This is a special repository that being used to store ideas and project managment publically, and to engage with fans.
