# Onboarding
## Pre Reqs
### Download Git
This is the engine that does the work of “Git” which is a source control program
https://git-scm.com/downloads/win

### Download TortoiseGit
This is a windows application that makes using Git (which is command line) much easier. This is optional but highly recommended.
https://tortoisegit.org/download/

### Install Arma Workbench 
If not installed. This is done through steam under tools.

### GitHub Account
This is how you’ll get the mod, add files and see tasks. It’s how we stay organized and protect our work against loss.
- Get one if you don’t have one
- Give Justin Kelly your ID to add you to the group
- You will get a invitation email granting you access

## Getting the mod
- Once you have access
- Navigateto https://github.com/Citizen-Group/SteelRain. This is our private code area
- Click on `code`
- Copy the URL from the code box
- Navigate to the addons folder of Arma Workbench `C:\Users\COMUTERNAME\Documents\My Games\ArmaReforgerWorkbench\addons`
- Right click and using TortoiseGit use Clone and the URL should jump in
- Hit ok. This will “Clone the repo” into your workbench
- You can now open workbench and see the mod

## Getting Tasks
Tasks are organized and delegated by the project lead, however if there is something that interests you, the workflow is flexible to move things around to accommodate making things easier and more enjoyable for you.

Our master list of ideas is found here: https://github.com/orgs/Citizen-Group/projects/15 or https://github.com/Citizen-Group/SteelRain-Ideas/issues (different formats)

When the project gets to a logical point, ideas are moved into the private repo and recreated as tasks with proper expansion, text and tracking.

The process repeats itself with ideas becoming tasks, which are completed and new ideas brought in as tasks to refill the list, seen here: https://github.com/Citizen-Group/SteelRain/issues

## Submitting work
### Build a branch
Branches are breakaways from the main body (trunk) that allow you to do work in a protected area that can be deleted in case of critical error, or if many projects are on the go, switched between.
Branches hold commits (saves) and are later merged into the main body (trunk).
#### Process
- Right clicking on the repo folder you cloned will bring up a list of git actions. 
- In Tortoise you will see `Switch/Checkout`

- Select `Create a new branch` and give it a meaningful name to what work you are doing
- On creation you will be switched to that branch,
- Alternatively in the *full menu* you can select `Create branch`
